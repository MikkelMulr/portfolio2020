				I'm Mike, a web developer and make of things from Toronto, Canada. A few years ago I decided to step away from
				my career as a freelance illustrator to persue something I always felt was my real goal, programming. From a
				humble "Hello World" to full fledged online websites and applications I used every step and stumble as a
				learning experience to grow and build new things. The problem solving and creativity that are required for every
				project bring a powerful sense of fullfilment and excitement that I have genuinely fallen in love with along the
				way.
